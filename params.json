{"name":"bSafeGenPass","tagline":"bSafeGenPass, is a fork of SuperGenPass, spiced up with bcrypt and special character support!","body":"# SuperGenPass\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chriszarate/supergenpass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chriszarate/supergenpass)\r\n\r\nThis is the official repository of [SuperGenPass][sgp]. Please see the\r\n[homepage][sgp] to obtain the bookmarklet and the mobile version. For\r\nquestions, please see the [FAQ][faq].\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nSuperGenPass is a different kind of password solution. Instead of storing your\r\npasswords on your hard disk or online—where they are vulnerable to theft and\r\ndata loss—SuperGenPass uses a hash algorithm to transform a master password\r\ninto unique, complex passwords for the Web sites you visit.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSuperGenPass(\"masterpassword:example1.com\") // => zVNqyKdf7F\r\nSuperGenPass(\"masterpassword:example2.com\") // => eYPtU3mfVw\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuperGenPass is a bookmarklet and runs right in your Web browser. It *never\r\nstores or transmits your passwords*, so it’s ideal for use on multiple and\r\npublic computers. It’s also completely free and open source.\r\n\r\n## Should I use SuperGenPass?\r\n\r\nMaybe! Do you like bookmarklets? Do you like *not knowing* what your passwords\r\nare? Do you like the idea of using a slightly quirky password solution? You\r\n*do*?\r\n\r\n## Develop locally\r\n\r\nSuperGenPass development requires [Grunt][grunt]:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/chriszarate/supergenpass.git && cd supergenpass\r\nnpm install\r\ngrunt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Looking for GenPass?\r\n\r\nGenPass is maintained in its own repository: [chriszarate/genpass][gp].\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSuperGenPass is released under the [GNU General Public License version 2][gplv2].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other implementations\r\n\r\nSince SuperGenPass is open-source, others have made their own versions for\r\nvarious platforms and with additional functionality. You can find a list on the\r\n[implementations wiki page][implementations].
